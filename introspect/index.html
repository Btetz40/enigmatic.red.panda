<h1>Introspect</h1>
<p>(3-24-19): It's been in incredibly hard day. I was so afraid of what i had done to see it. Haley is the best thing that i have ever come across and i dont know how to ever live my life in a light that she would be okay with. All I want is to hold her and let the world slip away. I don't want to be against her and i hate that that is where i have put myself.</p>
